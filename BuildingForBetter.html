					<h2> Why We Do This </h2>
				<!-- image for what we do section -->
					<p> <image src="images/child.jpg" alt="Child Sitting" class="Child">
						Building For Better is inspired by the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>,
						specifically Goal 1 - <i>'Ending Poverty In All Its Forms Everywhere.'</i> The United Nations website
						states that roughly 700 million people (or 10% of the world's population) is living in extreme poverty.
						This means that individuals and families struggle to find access to basic needs such as education, food,
						shelter, water and so much more which many people take for granted. Building For Better works to provide at
						least some of these necessities. Furthermore, providing people homes guarantees struggling families a sense of
						stability and safety in their tragically unstable and potentially dangerous lives.</p>
